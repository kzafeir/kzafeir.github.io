I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Science. My research focuses on developing reliable, trustworthy, and efficient machine learning systems, with particular interests in data-centric approaches, model serving optimization, privacy-preserving techniques, and information retrieval. My goal is to conduct doctoral research investigating the implications of large language models, focusing on enhancing their security, efficiency, and trustworthiness, while also advancing the development of interpretable AI for critical applications.

My work spans several key areas:

  - **Reliable and Trustworthy Machine Learning**: Developing methods to ensure ML systems are robust, fair, and interpretable
  - **Generative AI Safety**: Investigating failure modes in diffusion models and LLMs, specifically focusing on hallucination detection and artifact quantification in high-stakes domains (Remote Sensing, Healthcare).
  - **Efficient & Scalable Verification**: Improving the inference efficiency of verified models. I am interested in how system-level optimizations can make robust safety checks feasible in real-time deployment.
  - **Neural Network Auditing**: designing frameworks to interpret and audit neural network behavior for privacy leaks and spurious correlations.
  ## Current Work

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher at Elsevier B.V. & IRlab UvA, where I focus on machine unlearning techniques, model compliance, and privacy-preserving ML systems. I am also a co-founder of Jobly.ai, an AI-powered platform for matching candidates with opportunities using NLP-based resume parsing and transformer models.
