I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Science. My research focuses on developing reliable, trustworthy, and efficient machine learning systems, with particular interests in data-centric approaches, model serving optimization, privacy-preserving techniques, and information retrieval. My goald is to conduct doctoral research investigating the implications of large language models, focusing on enhancing their security, efficiency, and trustworthiness, while also advancing the development of interpretable AI for critical applications.

My work spans several key areas:

- **Reliable and Trustworthy Machine Learning**: Developing methods to ensure ML systems are robust, fair, and interpretable
- **Efficient Inference and Model Serving**: Improving the efficiency and scalability of ML model deployment
- **Privacy and Auditing in Neural Networks**: Ensuring privacy and enabling comprehensive auditing of neural network behavior
- **Information Retrieval**: Advancing search and retrieval systems using modern ML techniques
- **Natural Language Processing**: Applying NLP methods to real-world problems
- **Computer Vision & Signal Processing**: Applying advanced signal processing techniques and deep learning architectures (like ViTs) to solve problems in image analysis, particularly in detecting artifacts and ensuring data authenticity.
## Current Work

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher at Elsevier B.V. & IRlab UvA, where I focus on machine unlearning techniques, model compliance, and privacy-preserving ML systems. I am also a co-founder of Jobly.ai, an AI-powered platform for matching candidates with opportunities using NLP-based resume parsing and transformer models.
