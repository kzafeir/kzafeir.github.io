This paper presents a framework designed to detect and quantify hallucinations in remote sensing image inpainting systems. Building upon advanced computer vision techniques, the work addresses a critical challenge in generative image models for remote sensing applications: detecting when inpainting algorithms produce artifacts or unrealistic content that deviates from the original image context.

A novel architecture has been developed for hallucination detection specifically within remote sensing image inpainting, offering a unique and unprecedented capability. This architecture leverages sophisticated deep learning components, including Vision Transformers (ViT), fine-tuned image classifiers, and Class Activation Maps (CAMs), to analyze and identify inconsistencies in inpainted regions, thereby providing a new means of evaluating model reliability.

This research contributes to the broader field of reliable and trustworthy machine learning by providing tools for evaluating the quality and authenticity of generated image content, which is essential for applications requiring high-fidelity image reconstruction and editing.
