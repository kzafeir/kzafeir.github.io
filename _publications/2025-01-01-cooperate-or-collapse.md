This paper presents a reproducibility study building upon "Cooperate or Collapse: Emergence of Sustainable Cooperation in a Society of LLM Agents" (Piatti et al., 2024), a framework designed to test cooperation strategies among LLM agents in common pool resource environments. We replicate the original results and extend the analysis to include recent reasoning models (Phi-4, DeepSeek-R1, and distilled variants), finding that specialized reasoning-oriented models outperform general-purpose models of similar scale. We also investigate the impact of different prompting strategies, including the veil of ignorance mechanism and universalization principles with varying levels of abstraction. Our results suggest that older models benefit significantly from explicit boundary conditions, whereas newer models demonstrate greater robustness to implicit constraints.
